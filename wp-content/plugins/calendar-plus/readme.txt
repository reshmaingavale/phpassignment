== Installation ==
	
The installation is extremely simple and straightforward. It only takes a second.
	
Installing:
	
1. Upload the whole calendar directory into your WordPress plugins directory.

2. Activate the plugin on your WordPress plugins page
	
3. Configure Calendar using the following pages in the admin panel:
	
Calendar -> Manage Events
	
Calendar -> Manage Categories
	
Calendar -> Calendar Options
	
4. Edit or create a page on your blog which includes the text {CALENDAR ID} with the calendar ID you want posted and visit the page you have edited or created. You should see your calendar in action. If you want multiple calendar categories (as example categories 1-4) in the Calendar use the shortcode {CALENDAR 1,2,3,4} and if only a single category as example:
{CALENDAR 2}
Please do not confuse Calendar categories with Post categories. They are different. 

	
Uninstalling:
	
1. Deactivate the plugin on the plugins page of your blog dashboard
	
2. Delete the uploaded files for the plugin
	
3. Remove the text {CALENDAR ID} from the page you were using to show calendar, or delete that page
